  {
    question: "What is an eSIM?",
    answer: "An eSIM (embedded SIM) is a digital SIM that allows you to activate a cellular plan without using a physical SIM card. It's built into your device and can be programmed with different carrier profiles, making it perfect for travelers.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I install an eSIM?",
    answer: "After purchase, you'll receive a QR code via email. Simply go to your phone's settings, select 'Add eSIM' or 'Add Cellular Plan', and scan the QR code. The eSIM will be installed in seconds.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is my device compatible with eSIM?",
    answer: "Most modern smartphones support eSIM, including iPhone XS and newer, Samsung Galaxy S20 and newer, Google Pixel 3 and newer, and many other devices. Check our compatibility page for a full list.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I keep my WhatsApp number?",
    answer: "Yes! The eSIM provides data connectivity only. Your original phone number and WhatsApp will continue to work as before. You can use both SIMs simultaneously.",
  },
  {
    question: "When does my data plan start?",
    answer: "Your data plan activates when you first connect to a mobile network in your destination country. You can install the eSIM before you travel, and it will start working when you arrive.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if I run out of data?",
    answer: "You can easily top up your data through our app or website. Additional data packages are available for purchase at any time, and they're added to your existing eSIM instantly.",
